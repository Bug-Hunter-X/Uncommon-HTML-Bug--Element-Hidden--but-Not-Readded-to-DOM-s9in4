# Uncommon HTML Bug: Element Hidden, Not Readded to DOM

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML and JavaScript where an element is hidden using `display: none;`, but it's never re-added to the DOM, resulting in unexpected behavior when trying to modify or access it later.

## Bug Description:
The `bug.html` file shows a simple example where a div element is hidden using JavaScript.  The issue lies in the absence of code to re-insert the div (or make it visible) after the `display: none;` is set. This is a subtle error that may not be immediately obvious.  If later code attempts to interact with the hidden element, problems arise.

## Solution:
The `solution.html` file demonstrates how to resolve this. The key is to manage the element's visibility appropriately. You can re-add the element using display: block, or use other visibility methods to toggle the element and its interaction with the rest of the page.
